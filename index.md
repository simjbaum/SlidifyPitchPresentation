## Hi my name is Simon

I live here:  

<img src="figure/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png" title="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-1" alt="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-1" width="50%" />
  
and I developed the "Data Explorer"  ... but its a fairly simple tool

## What is "The Data Explorer"?
> * I need to plot these variables 
> * and these variables 
> * and these ...yes we got it ... but I need to calculate the linear regression and get the rÂ² value ...  
> * I wish there were a tool for that ...

>   THERE IS!

## what does the data explorer do?  
You can choose between the datasets (and the code is at my github and you can add and improve code if you want to):

> 1. mtcars
> 2. airquality
> 3. iris

>  then you can choose between variables of the dataset to be plotted to each other and the regression line will be added in a plotly plot, for example like this:  
>  *  
<img src="figure/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png" title="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-2" alt="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-2" width="35%" />
