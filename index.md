## What is "The Data Explorer"
I need to plot those variables and these variables and i need to calculate the linear regression and get the rÂ² value ...  
I wish there were a tool for that ...
THERE IS!

"The Data Explorer"

The Data Explorer you can find here:
[The Data Explorer - Shiny App](https://github.com/simjbaum/StatisticInferenceAssignment1)

## what does the data explorer do?  

You can choose between the datasets:

> 1. mtcars
> 2. airquality
> 3. iris

>  then you can choose between variables of the dataset to be plotted to each other and the regression line will be added in a plotly plot, for example like this:
>   

<img src="figure/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png" title="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-2" alt="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-2" width="30%" />
